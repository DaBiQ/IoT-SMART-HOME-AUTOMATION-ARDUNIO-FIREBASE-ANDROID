# IoT-SMART-HOME-AUTOMATION-ARDUNIO-FIREBASE-ESP8266-ANDROID-MyHome
Iot based Smart Home Automation connected with firebase and Android
Also integrated with google assistant and the telegram using dialogflow
ESP8266 is main controller in IoT

# What sensor and Devices are use?

1. Esp8266 board
2. Relays Modules * 6
3. load *6 
4. Resistors *18
5- Capacitors *6
6- 7805 Voltage regulatosr
7- Wires
8- PZEM â€“ 004T 80-260V 100A module 

# PROPOSED SYSTEM
1. Electrical port switching (on/off): User can switch ON the electrical ports and
switch OFF the electrical ports. There will be total 6 ports.
2. Automatic on/off the electrical ports: User will select Days, Start Time, Stop Time
for the particular electrical port. At selected days & time the electrical port will
automatically turned ON & turned OFF.
3. Electricity consumption monitoring: User will get the real time consumption
information in the mobile. User will get the information such as energy consumption,
power consumption, current consumption, bill (in rs). User can see the graph of the
consumption.

#TO DO
